# Prompt Log
timestamp_utc: 2026-02-08T00:32:00Z
step: documentation
goal: Add a linear journal file with prompts, errors, fixes, and outcomes.

## prompt
what also need is a "journal" file, that has the step by step history of the prompts I'm writing here.
This is because I want to read a linear story of steps I took in order to get everything done. It will be important to notice the prompts I did, what errors I encounter, how they were fixed and things like that.

## response_summary
Created a run journal at artifacts/immunotherapy_20260207_121552/journal.md and updated the skill file to require journal.md for reproducibility.
